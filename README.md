# EVOFLUx-Spatial-Model
MSc Project: An Agent-based Model of Tracing Tumour Evolution with Spatially Constrained fCpG Dynamics

spatial_mode.py : Construct the two-dimensional grid of demes, and integrate the spatial models (gland fission, boundary growth, subclonal gland fission, and subclonal boundary growth) into the EVOFLUx framework.

plot clustermap.py : plot the clustermap of methylation fraction (beta value), annotated by the radius, angle and subclonal fraction (if subclonal selection) of each deme.

plot comparison.py: plot the annotated box plot of Wasserstein distances among different pairs of spatial model simulations.
